            <p>My name is Jeanie Gonzalez. I'm a rising senior in Mott Hall 5. I grew up loving to draw houses with a colorful rainbow right on top and wanting to be an architect, mostly because I loved building things with legos. But knowing how to code is an important aspect in the world now and even more in the future. With Girls Who Code, I got the chance to explore this option which I ended up loving. Even though I still have my mind and heart set out on Architecture, I hope that one day in my career I get to combine both Architecture and computer science.
